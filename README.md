Flareact is an **edge-rendered React framework** powered by Cloudflare Workers.

It's inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

That means it supports nice API patterns like:

- File-based routing
- Dynamic page paths
- Data fetching for page props using `getStaticProps`
- Universal application rendering (server and client)

However, it's brand new! So it's also a bunch of these things:

- An early prototype
- Missing years worth of optimizations the Next.js team has implemented
- Probably has a heavy bundle
- Styles? Sort of borked right now
